# Practical sessions for Information Theory

This project is dedicated to post all the practical sessions subjects and corrections I made for my engineer students for the Information theory class.

## Language information

Those practical sessions are Jupyter notebooks in Python 3.6. No further libraries than ones provided by anaconda sould be needed to make the practical sessions work.

## Content

The practical session will be uploaded with their corrections gradually during the semester. The different algorithm treated during this class are the following:
* Shannon-Fano coding (Codage de Shannon-Fano)
* Huffman coding (Codage de Huffman)
* Arithmetic coding (Codage Arithm√©tique)
* Cyclic coding (Codes cycliques)
* Lempel-Ziv coding (Codage de Lempel-Ziv)
* Data encryption (Chiffrement)
* Run-lenght coding (Codage par plages)
